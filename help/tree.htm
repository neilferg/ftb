<h2>Family Tree Diagram<br>
</h2>

Below is an extract of the BAMPOT family tree, which will be used as
an example.<br>

<br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img style="width: 613px; height: 224px;" alt="" src="images/tree_extract.png"><br>
</div>

<br>

<ul>

  <li>Each <span style="font-style: italic;">rectangular </span>box
is an <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">individual</span>,
who
is a <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">member </span>of&nbsp;
the tree. Males are coloured blue,
females pink. For tree members, only their forenames are listed.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>When it is available birth and death dates will
also be shown. A '~' in front of a date indicates an approximation.</li>
      <li>Where a birth date is available, an birth ordinal will be
shown. In the diagram above, Jane Bampot
is the 2nd child of Bob Bampot.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Each <span style="font-style: italic;">elliptical </span>box
represents a <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">spouse
    </span>(normally a <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">marriage</span>). The
date of a marriage may be indicated by "m. <span style="font-style: italic;">date</span>". Spouses - there may be
multiple - are always placed to the right of the individual.<br>
In the diagram above, Elizabeth Smith is Bob Bampot's wife.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Married women are not treated as members of the tree - their
details may be found in the tree to which is
associated with their <span style="font-style: italic;">maiden </span>name.
In
the example above,&nbsp; Elizabeth Smith's
details will be found in the SMITH tree.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Lines flowing down from an individual to other rectangular boxes
are links to <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">children
    </span>of
that individual.<br>
In the diagram, Dave Bampot and Jane are children of Bob Bampot.</li>
  <li>Hovering the mouse over a box will usually give more information
about that individual's vital record event dates.<br>
  </li>
  <li>If further information on an individual or spouse (<a href="individual.htm#Vital_Records">vital
records</a>, <a href="individual.htm#Secondary_Records">census</a>,
etc) is
available, it may be accessed by clicking the box. This will take you
to
the <a href="individual.htm">individual's details page</a>.</li>
  <li>Boxes that have a turn down <img style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" alt="" src="images/turn_down.gif">
in the top right corner indicate that there is additional information
(over and above vital records) available for that individual and will
be found in the "Other Notes" link for that individual. This
might include things like military records, voter's roll entries,
emigration etc.</li>
</ul>
