<h2>Individual's Details Page<br>
</h2>
An example of an <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">individual's
details</span> is shown below<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img style="border: 1px solid ; width: 717px; height: 511px;" alt="" src="images/individual_page.png"><br>
</div>
<br>
There are three headings on this page: <a href="#Vital_Records">Vital
Records</a>, <a href="#Children">Children</a> and <a href="#Secondary_Records">Secondary Records</a>.<br>
<h3><a name="Vital_Records"></a>Vital Records</h3>
The so called <span style="font-style: italic;">vital records</span>
consist of <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">birth</span>,
<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">marriage </span>and
<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">death </span>event
registration.<br>
If a certificate is available for a particular event, it may be viewed
by clicking on the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">certificate</span>
link<br>
<br>
If you are interested in the process of research, clicking on the <span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Birth:</span>,
<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Death:</span>
or <span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Marriage:</span>
links (if present) will take you to to details of the searches
performed.<br>
<br>
It is possible to navigate directly to the father or mother's details
page from here by clicking on their names.<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="Children"></a>Children</h3>
This section lists the individual's children. Clicking on a child's
name will take
you to their details page.<br>
For a father, this will list all found children (bearing the same
surname).<br>
For a mother, however only those children whose birth record explicitly
states her to be the mother will be listed. This limitation arises from
the fact that the majority of people were found though census searches,
which give limited information on the parentage of a child.<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="Secondary_Records"></a>Secondary Records</h3>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Census
Searches</span>. These are a very important source of information on a
family. Census are held every 10 years in the UK. The earliest is 1841,
and the latest is 1911.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Other
Notes</span> This is a sort of catch all, but may include things like
military records, emigration, voter's roll entries etc.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Other
Files</span> This is a list of miscellaneous files that are not
referenced in any other document pages.<br>
